An awesome Vim config for development, slow roasted with a Ruby twist and a shot of web-dev.

# Installing
Assuming you already have vim, just run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/frederic-wong/vim-config.git ~/.vim && ~/.vim/install
```

Should this not leave you with a nice working vim (certain vims are a bit iffy about the last line) then launch vim and run `:PlugUpdate`

If you are using zsh there may be an issue running tests with ,t (it can't find the bundle). If you don't already have an /etc/zprofile file it can be fixed by doing the following:

```bash
sudo mv /etc/zshenv /etc/zprofile
```

## External Dependencies
There are a couple of things you need to install to get the best out of this config:
* ctags - enables tags support when working with code
* Ag - enables grepping through the current directories with [the_silver_searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher)
* NodeJS - enables integration for JS tools listed here

# Updating
```bash
cd ~/.vim
git pull
```

* If you've installed the auto-update hook, the git pull should trigger Vim to update and you're done!
* Manually update by opening Vim and running `:PlugClean` and `:PlugUpdate`.

# Personalisation
We all like things a little differently, so there are a couple of ways to easily tweak and add to the config.

## Add more plugins
Simply write normal plugin lines to `~/.vim.plugins.local`.
For example:
```
Plug 'AdamWhittingham/projector_mode'
```

## Set up, override or extend config
Changes like using a different font or colour scheme can be made by writing Vim config into `~/.vimrc.local`

## Powerline

This config comes ready to use either with or without a Powerline patched font. As detecting the powerline characters is pretty much impossible, you can enable this by setting `POWERLINE=1` in your shell (ie. in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`).
Note that this is *off* by default.


# Using the config

There is no replacement for having a look through the config and seeing which plugins are installed and which key bindings are set. However, that can be a bit daunting, so here are the highlights!

The defeault `<leader>` key is Space.

| `cs<a><b>`            | Change surround <a> for <b> (ie. `cs("` will change round brackets for double quotes)                             |
